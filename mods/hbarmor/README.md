# HUD bar for `3d_armor` [`hbarmor`]

* Version: 0.4.0

## Description
This mod adds a simple HUD bar which displays the current damage
of the player's armor (from the 3D Armor [`3d_armor`] mod) as a percentage (rounded).

100% armor means the armor is in perfect shape. 0% means the armor is almost destroyed
or non-existant. Note that to reach 100%, the player must wear at least 4 different
pieces of armor in perfect shape.

The armor bar also does not tell anything about the armor's strength,
only how worn out it already is.

By default, the armor bar is hidden if the player wears no armor.

## Dependencies
* HUD bars [`hudbars`], major version 1
* 3D Armor [`3d_armor`] (tested with Minetest 0.4.14)

## Licensing
This mod is entirly free softare.
