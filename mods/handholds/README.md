handholds
===

Mountain climbing mod for Minetest by Shara RedCat which adds a climbing pick tool. Use the tool to add handholds to stone, desert stone, sandstone and ice which can then be climbed.

The tool can be crafted using diamonds and sticks. 

Nodes cannot be placed directly in front of handholds, and falling nodes landing in front of handholds will remove the handholds and restore the original node.

Thanks to paramat, Zeno, LazyJ, Billre and NathanS21 for testing and suggestions.
